## IIT Mandi Git Hero 2022
We welcome you all to Git Hero 2022


## Plot
There are two friends, Paddu and Vicku (you know who they are ;P).

Hint: Paddu is a pro level comder while Vicku is a graphic designing gawd.

Vicku is a very short-tempered guy. Interestingly, Vicku got infected with a deadly and contagious disease ‘F’. As he was in quarantine and was feeling agitated, there are chances that he might come out and spread the disease throughout the campus. So, his good friend Paddu, in an attempt to stop Vicku, developed a game. But, there are some bugs in the game that need to be fixed and Vicku is a noob when it comes to using git.

If Vicku is not able to play the game, he will come out of his quarantine and spread the disease throughout the campus. Hence, in order to stop this madness and save yourself from getting infected by ‘F’, you need to help Vicku in removing bugs from the game.


## Get started
To get started, go to the [issues](https://github.com/KamandPrompt/GitHero_2022/issues) tab. Start with the challenge 1 to challenge 7. The scores for them are alongside and they go in order, so until you complete the challenge1, you cannot move to challenge2. You need to complete previous challenges first.

## Submission
You need to document all the steps you follow along the way in a file named `report.md`
Once you are done with the as many challenges as you were able to solve, you need to make a final Pull Request containing that file. 
The marks you get for each question will depend on the quality of your commits, time taken to make the commits, and how well you are able to explain the steps taken.

## Some tips
Google, git status and git log are your best friends in this challenge.
Try to complete as many challenge as you can. All the Best! What are you waiting for now? Go start with the challenges.


## After finishing all the challenges
